- 👋 Hi, I’m Hugo, and located in the Netherlands. 
- 👀 I’m interested in many things related to software, IT and (enterprise) architecture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program in Clojure, by (slowly) working on my [virtual-me](https://github.com/hugovalk/virtual-me) chatbot. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might peek my interest. 
- 📫 You can reach me via Twitter [@hugovalk](https://twitter.com/hugovalk)
